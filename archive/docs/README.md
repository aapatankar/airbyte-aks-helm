## Current Documentation Structure

The project now uses a simplified documentation structure:

- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive consolidated documentation
- `archive/docs/` - This archive of original files

This consolidation reduces documentation fragmentation and provides a single source of truth for all project information.
